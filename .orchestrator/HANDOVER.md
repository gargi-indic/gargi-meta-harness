## Backlog
Epics are milestones. Tasks are real GitHub sub-issues with `blocked_by` links, and every task body has Scope, Acceptance criteria and Out of scope sections.

| Epic | Milestone | Tasks |
|---|---|---|
| #2 | M0 Foundations | #3–#9 |
| #10 | M1 Engine + Jules + reviewer (CLI) | #11–#21 |
| #22 | M2 Command center + playbook editor | #23–#32 |
| #33 | M3 Local agents + parallelism | #34–#42 |
| #43 | M4 Planner | #44–#50 |
| #51 | M5 Copilot, Antigravity, ops | #52–#59 |

`needs-discussion` (each states a proposed default; escalate on reaching it unless the human has confirmed): #40 (M3.7 parallel branch semantics), #44 (M4.1 what counts as plan approval), #52 (M5.1 Copilot route), #53 (M5.2 agy spike is half-manual: the human runs the probe locally).
The UI design system is in `docs/DESIGN.md` and `docs/design/tokens.css`.

## Decisions recorded
| Date | Decision | By |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-14 | Own small engine (not LangGraph); Python 3.12 + uv + FastAPI + pydantic v2; Vite + React + TS + React Flow UI | human |
| 2026-10-14 | Gates configurable per playbook; visual editor in v1; local web app; act as the human's `gh` token | human |
| 2026-10-14 | v1 adapters: Jules, Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Antigravity | human |
| 2026-10-14 | Built by Jules via this orchestrator (one session at a time); the orchestrator merges after review | human |

## State
- 2026-10-14: seed pushed (README and `docs/PLAN.md`), log issue #1 created, M0 and M1 backlog created, orchestrator files committed. The next step is to start #3 (M0.1 scaffold + CI).
